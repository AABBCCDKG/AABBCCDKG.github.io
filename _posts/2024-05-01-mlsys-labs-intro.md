This is a brief introduction to top-tier MLSys labs for Ph.D. applicants, with a primary focus on those in the United States and mainland China.
# United States

## [Google Brain](https://research.google/)

## [Microsoft Research (MSR)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/)
[Fast and Efficient Infrastructure for Distributed Deep Learning](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/fiddle/)

## [Catalyst (Carnegie Mellon University)](https://catalyst.cs.cmu.edu/)
[Eric Xing: ](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/)

[Tianqi Chen: ](https://tqchen.com/)[TVM](https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi18/presentation/chen), [XGBoost](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02754), [MXNet](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/1512.01274).

[Zhihao Jia: ](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zhihaoj2/)[TASO](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://cs.stanford.edu/~padon/taso-sosp19.pdf). Note: Prof. Zhihao Jia seems to be more focused on system for LLM.


## [DSAIL (MIT)](https://dsail.csail.mit.edu/)
[Song Han: ](https://hanlab.mit.edu/songhan)Pruning and Sparse related work. Prof. Song Han seems to be working on algorithm modifications and hardware, and he's not really focused on TinyML anymore. Now he's working on diffusion models and LLM models.

[Tim Kraska: ](https://people.csail.mit.edu/kraska/)


## [CSAIL (MIT)](https://www.csail.mit.edu/)
[Tim Kraska: ](https://people.csail.mit.edu/kraska/) Learned Index and a series of after things

[Saman Amarasinghe: ](https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/saman-amarasinghe)[Halide](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://people.csail.mit.edu/jrk/halide-pldi13.pdf), [TACO](https://tacos.libraries.mit.edu/).

## [Stanford DAWN Project](https://dawn.cs.stanford.edu/)
[Matei Zaharia (now in Cal): ](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~matei/) Matei Zaharia (Stanford & Databricks) is highly respected for building [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) (one of the most widely used frameworks for distributed data processing, and co-started other datacenter software such as Apache Mesos and Spark Streaming) from scratch to a billion-dollar level. He serves as a PC and chair for major conferences. PipeDream, TASO, and FlexFlow is the project built by his Ph.D. student.Zhihao jia is his Ph.D. student. and  his students' projects like PipeDream, TASO by Zhihao Jia, and FlexFlow. One standout aspect of his research is that it addresses real system needs, making it impactful and practical. Not all his work prioritizes performance; for instance, one recent paper discusses offloading computation to GPUs using annotation for ease of use. Overall, pursuing a PhD under his guidance would likely lead to significant influence in the industry.

## [Hazy Research (Stanford AI Lab)](https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/index)
This research group focuses on MLSys and also organized a seminar series called [Stanford MLSys Seminar Series](https://mlsys.stanford.edu/)

## [RISELab (University of California, Berkeley)](https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/)
[Ion Stoica: ](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~istoica/) 

[Michael Jordan: ](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/)

Most recent project: [Ray](https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/projects/ray/)

Professors at RISE Lab have offered a course called [AI for Systems and Systems for AI (CS294)](https://ucbrise.github.io/cs294-ai-sys-fa19/)

## [System Lab (University of Washington)](https://www.cs.washington.edu/research/systems)
[Luis Ceze: ](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~luisceze/) 

[Arvind Krishnamurthy: ](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/arvind)

## [Sample (University of Washington)](https://sampl.cs.washington.edu/)

## [SymbioticLab (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor)](https://symbioticlab.org/)
[Mosharaf Chowdhury (the academic leader): ](https://www.mosharaf.com/) He offers the course [Systems for AI (EECS598)](https://github.com/mosharaf/eecs598/tree/w21-ai)


## [System Group (New York University)](http://www.news.cs.nyu.edu/)
[Jinyang Li: ](https://cims.nyu.edu/people/profiles/LI_Jinyang.html) She is the Ph.D. advisor of [Minjie Wang](https://jermainewang.github.io/)(the author of DGL)

## [Shivaram Venkataraman Research Group (University of Wisconsin, Madison)](https://shivaram.org/)


## [EcoSystem (University of Toronto)](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/ecosystem/)
[Gennady Pekhimenko: ](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~pekhimenko/)


# China
In mainland China, it seems that most of the work in MLSys is being don in companies. However, some strong teams in distributed systems often also work on MLSys to some extent, such as [IPADS (Shanghai Jiaotong Univeristy).](https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/zh/index.html)

## [Microsoft Research Lab(Asia)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/systems-and-networking-research-group-asia/)

## [PACMAN Group(Tsinghua)](https://pacman.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/)
More related to Arch

## [Center for Energy-efficient Computing and Applications(Peking University)](https://ceca.pku.edu.cn/people/index.htm)
More related to Arch

## [Cheng LI's Research Group (Univeristy of Science and Technology China)](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~chengli7)


## [IPADS(Shanghai Jiaotong Univeristy)](https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/zh/index.html)
The best System Lab in Mainland China, and now is also working on some MLSys projects.

## Some people worth following on Zhihu
[Tianqi Chen: ](https://www.zhihu.com/people/crowowrk) Prof. Tianqi Chen is an Assistant Professor at Carnegie Mellon University . He help run the [Catalyst Group](https://catalyst.cs.cmu.edu/).

[Huaizheng Zhang: ](https://www.zhihu.com/people/zhanghuaizheng) Dr. Huaizheng Zhang's [AI-System-School](https://github.com/HuaizhengZhang/AI-System-School) is an open project aimed at collecting and organizing research papers, tools, and resources related to MLSys, Large Language Models (LLM), and Generative AI (GenAI). It provides researchers and engineers with a systematic learning path and practical guide to help them better understand and apply these cutting-edge technologies.
