Full Binary Tree (Proper Binary Tree)

- every node has either exactly two children or no children.

Perfect Binary Tree (Strictly Full Binary Tree):

- Every internal node has two children
- All leaf nodes appear at the same depth(level).
- Level (k) start from 0
    - Every level has `2^k` nodes (Level(k) start from 0).
    - Total nodes: `2^(k+1) - 1`.
- Level (k) start from 1
    - Every level has `2^(k - 1)`. nodes (Level(k) start from 0)
    - Total nodes: `2^(k) - 1`.

Complete Binary Tree:

- Every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled.
- In the last level, all nodes are as far left as possible, with no “gaps” between them.
- heap is a complete binary tree.

Binary Search Tree:
- Average case for search and insert: O(log n) when the tree is approximately balanced (each comparison eliminates about half of the remaining nodes).
- Worst case for search and insert: O(n) if the tree becomes completely unbalanced (degenerates into a chain).
- Left -> Small, Top -> Medium, Right -> Big
- No requirement for node structure

Balanced Binary Search Tree:
- ∀ N: height(N.left) – height(N.right) ≤ 1
- the basic of map and set (the key in map and the element in set is in order)

```python
# Initialization by Linked List:
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val = 0, left = None, right = None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

# Initialization by List:
list = []
curr: list[index] 
left_children: list[2 * index + 1]
right_children: list[2 * index + 2]
```

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val = 0, left = None, right = None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
def list_to_complete_binary_tree(nums: List[int], i = 0):
    if i > len(nums) - 1:
        return
    node = ListNode(nums[i])
    node.left = list_to_complete_binary_tree(nums, i * 2 + 1)
    node.right = list_to_complete_binary_tree(nums, i * 2 + 2)
    return node
```
