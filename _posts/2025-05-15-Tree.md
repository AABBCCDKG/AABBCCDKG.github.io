Full Binary Tree (Proper Binary Tree)

- every node has either exactly two children or no children

Perfect Binary Tree (Strictly Full Binary Tree):

- Every internal node has two children
- All leaf nodes appear at the same depth(level)
- Level (k) start from 0
    - Every level has `2^k` nodes (Level(k) start from 0)
    - Total nodes: `2^(k+1) - 1`
- Level (k) start from 1
    - Every level has `2^(k - 1)` nodes (Level(k) start from 0)
    - Total nodes: `2^(k) - 1`

Complete Binary Tree:

- Every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled

- In the last level, all nodes are as far left as possible, with no “gaps” between them.
