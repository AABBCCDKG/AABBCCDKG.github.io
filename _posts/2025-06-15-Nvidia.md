[238. Product of Array Except Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/description/?envType=company&envId=nvidia&favoriteSlug=nvidia-three-months)

When there are no elements to multiple at a certain position, the product should be initialized as `1`, since `1` is the identity element for multiplication and does not affect the overall result. That is the reason why `left_prod` and `right_prod` are both initialized as `1`.

```python
from typing import List
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        left_prod = 1
        right_prod = 1
        result = []
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            # append the left_prod first, update the left_prod with current element second to except self
            result.append(left_prod)
            left_prod *= nums[i]
        
        for i in range(len(nums)-1, -1, -1):
            result[i] *= right_prod
            right_prod *= nums[i]
        return result
```
