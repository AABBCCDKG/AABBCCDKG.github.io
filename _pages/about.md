Hi👋 I am an undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor of Science Degree in Computer Science at the College of Science, Purdue University, West Lafayette. 

I’m particularly passionate about careers in **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Software Engineering (SWE)**, **Machine Learning Engineering (MLE)**, and **Quantitative Research/Development (Quant)**.

### ⚡️My past experience
**Software Engineer Intern**  
*Amazon Web Services (AWS) · Seattle, WA · Aug 2025 – Present*  
Worked on scalable backend services supporting production reliability.

**AI Startup School Participant**  
*Y Combinator · San Francisco · Jun 2025*  
Collaborated on building generative AI applications from scratch.

**Undergraduate Research Assistant**  
*Purdue AI Lab · Jan 2024 – Present*  
Built physics-informed deep learning models for video motion prediction.

**Technical Team Member**  
*Purdue Aerial Robotics (VIP Program) · Jan 2024 – May 2025*  
Designed drone control system using hand-drawn sketches + GANs.

**Software Engineer Intern**  
*Bank of China · Shanghai · Jun 2023 – Aug 2023*  
Developed a symbolic regression model for customer satisfaction prediction.

🌱 So far, I have attempted some interesting personal projects, such as:

- [EchoGen](https://github.com/AABBCCDKG/EchoGen): An iterative optimization system that refines LLM-generated results through iterative feedback.
- [SmartGA](https://github.com/AABBCCDKG/LLM-guided_GA_for_function_fitting): Using LLM to guide the direction of the evolution of the Genetic Algorithm.
- [SketchTune](https://github.com/AABBCCDKG/clip_on_sketch): Fine-tuning the CLIP model on the sketch (The Sketchy Database).
- [Gmaillm](https://github.com/AABBCCDKG/gmaillm): Utilizing LLM to summarize important Gmail messages and discard irrelevant ones.
