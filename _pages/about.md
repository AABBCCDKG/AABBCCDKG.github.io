Hi 👋 I’m an undergraduate majoring in Computer Science at Purdue University. After transferring from Northeastern University (China), where I studied ECE (Sep 2022 – Dec 2023), I completed 93% of my Purdue CS degree requirements in just 1.5 years.

I’ve interned at Amazon AWS and the Bank of China as a Software Engineer. I’ve also conducted [research](https://royal-celestite-49a.notion.site/Motion-Prediction-through-Physical-Laws-b75fba68cf2f414e9ebd9f84c0db00d7) on physics-informed deep learning under [Prof. Yexiang Xue](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/yexiang/) at Purdue AI Lab, joined the Purdue Aerial Robotics Team, and participated in Y Combinator’s AI Startup School.
