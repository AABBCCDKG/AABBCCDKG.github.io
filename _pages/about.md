Hi üëã I'm an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at Purdue University, College of Science. Before transferring to Purdue, I studied Communication Engineering at Northeastern University (China) for one year and a half.


I‚Äôm currently seeking full-time opportunities in Software Engineering (SWE), Machine Learning Engineering (MLE), and Quantitative Research/Development (Quant).

In Fall 2025, I will join Amazon Web Services (AWS Fintech) as a Software Engineer Intern.

As a Research Assistant at the Purdue AI Lab, I worked under [Prof. Yexiang Xue](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/yexiang/) on physics-informed deep learning. I developed [models](https://royal-celestite-49a.notion.site/Motion-Prediction-through-Physical-Laws-b75fba68cf2f414e9ebd9f84c0db00d7) that improve video motion prediction by integrating neural networks with physical laws, helping bridge the gap between data-driven and physically-grounded modeling.

My passion for intelligent robotics led me to the [Purdue Aerial Robotics Team](https://www.purdueaerial.com/), where I helped design a drone control system that interprets hand-drawn sketches using GANs and vision models to guide autonomous flight.

Previously, I interned at the [Bank of China](https://www.boc.cn/en/) as a Software Engineer, where I built a symbolic regression system to predict customer satisfaction using structured financial data.

I also participated in [Y Combinator‚Äôs AI Startup School](https://events.ycombinator.com/ai-sus).
